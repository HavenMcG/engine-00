Hello, this project is a game and/or game engine. Both of these components are as yet unnamed.
The engine will likely not have a standalone editor etc but the project will hopefully be designed in a way that allows me to repurpose the engine code for use in future endeavors.

This project is for educational purposes though I hope to keep working on it long term.
I learned the basics of OpenGL in late July 2024 and began this project shortly after. As I am still a college student and new to graphics and engine programming (and large-scale programming in general), progress happens slowly.

Currently (2024-09-04) the main branch loads up a simple scene containing an oversized 3d model, a hexagonal grid shader and a small hex map that responds to being moused over.
Use WASD to move around the scene.
